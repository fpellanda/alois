        A system like Apache ALOIS can never be installed in a few minutes. Therefore, you might want to try out our on-line <a href="demo.html">demo</a> first. At the moment, there are some Linux skills asked to install Apache ALOIS. In the future we plan to offer a live cd, so you can easily test Apache ALOIS and create an instance in a virtual environment.

         Since Apache ALOIS is written in Ruby, it should run on many platforms and operation systems. But there might be some severe problems with dependencies. At the moment we have no experiences but with Debian and Ubuntu based installations. Therefore, we would love to get to know if you have - sucessfully or not - installed Apache ALOIS on another platform. And maybe you would like to become part of the active community and contribute your installation how-to.
