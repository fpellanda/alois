         After the login you find yourself on the overview page of Apache ALOIS. There you get a picture of the flow of data. The traffic lights tells you if there are any security issues. Above the traffic lights you can see the numbers of alarms and reports there are not yet responded. The numbers in respectively besides the arrows is the average pass rate in seconds (the lower the better). Inside the "pumpy" square, the percentage explains, if there are any imports outstanding or not - the higher the percentage, the bigger the bottleneck.

        Since this first page is "only" a dashboard for the administration, by surfing through the menu you can take a closer look at the functionality of Apache ALOIS. The menu "Views" might be of the most interest for you. There you can browse through the log messages. Since Apache ALOIS structures the logs in different types to get a better view on it, there are different views.
